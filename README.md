 Introduction

With the advent of globalization, the ecosystem of universities in the US has become more vibrant than ever. This provides us with all the more reason to have an application that can bring together people from different cultures and communities. Hence, UCoN: a University students’ Social Network. It helps users connect with each other, interact, converse, and share experiences.
The key features of our system include the following:

● Studentscansignup/login/logoutofthenetworkusingtheiremailid.

● Students would be required to create a profile which would include entering their photo id, date of birth, interests, etc.

● An event (an event can be a project, collaborative meeting and other activities) can be created by a student which will be posted with various details like event name, location, description, etc.

● Students can also post things (text, photos, videos) which can then be commented upon by other students.

● Students can interact with each other by sending and receiving messages among themselves.

● To improve the interactive experience, students can form groups and do activities/messaging together.

● A student can have various relationships with one or more students. Those relationships can be classified as: friend, follower, none, blocked.

● Astudentcanalsoaccept/declinefriendrequestsfromotherstudents
